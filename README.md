# Analysis of Ocean Wave Heights off the Coast of Ireland
Processing the data in Marine datasets and analysing the effect of certain variables on wave height


## Data 

Data was retrieved from two sources, **Met Eirann buoys** and from **Satellite data**:


Met Eireann data is taken from buoys at different locations. Each buoy corresponds to a csv file and each buoy measures:
* *wavht* - wave heights
* *wdsp* - wind speed
* *per* - wave period
* *temp* - air temperature
* *seatp* - sea temperature
* *mxwave* - maximum wave height in the previous hour

The satellite data measures wave heights and wave periods and is stored in NetCDF fromat. Measurments are taken over longitude and latitude coordinants as seen in the heatmap of output 24 in report.ipynb.
